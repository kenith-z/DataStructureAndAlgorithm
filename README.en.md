##Introduction
This is a project of learning data institutions. As we all know, the essence of this program is data structure + algorithm.
If a programmer does not know the data structure and algorithm, he is a brick carrying coder farmer.
No matter how new the framework you learn, no matter how powerful the middleware you use, you don't know the underlying data structure and algorithm, you just stay in the know how to use it. As for the high-level performance optimization, at best, you can only watch Baidu and eat the rest.
How to adjust it? Why to adjust it like this? You don't know. You use the 
is results of others. As for whether can really improve performance, you don't know, because you don't know.
